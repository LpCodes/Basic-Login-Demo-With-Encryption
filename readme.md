## Importing required libraries
The script requires following libraries to be installed on the system in order to function properly:

1. pathlib for handling file system paths and operations
2. sys for interacting with the interpreter
3. cryptocode for encrypting the password
4. json for reading and writing JSON files.
## Functionality
This script allows users to register a new account by creating a new JSON file named 'cd.json' or adding new data to an existing one, and logging into the account by providing the correct credentials. The script also encrypts the password before storing it in the JSON file for added security.
